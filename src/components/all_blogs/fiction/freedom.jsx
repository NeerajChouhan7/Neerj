                <p>There is a mood for mothers in the morning where they are in between shouting and slapping you. Due to my small but regular experience, I sensed that a slap could come and wake me up anytime, so I woke up. Tea was already beside me with 2 <em className='i'>tosh</em>. Mom said, ‚ÄúQuickly, get ready, I will send the lunch in the recess.‚Äù It‚Äôs only a matter of time when my bus driver uncle will be shouting my name from outside. I always think that that‚Äôs how die-hard fans shout from outside of the house. And in that daydreaming, I forgot to tie my shoelaces. With a tie in my hand because I don‚Äôt know how to tie one. I ran towards the bus with a bag only on my one shoulder. That was the only weight we were carrying at that age on our shoulders. We wish we always have the same enthusiasm as we had in our childhood. But it is beautiful only when you‚Äôre staring at the clouds, in the nostalgia of your childhood. Suddenly back pain comes in that picture of you running and playing as a child and reminds you of your real age and the other age according to your back.
                <br /><br />
                Just another day, went and slapped my friend from behind, unlike a normal human being he smiled. Told him to tie my tie. While he was putting a tie in his neck, I asked him if he had done the homework because I haven‚Äôt. He said he also forgot, I was relaxed.
                <br /><br />
Recess‚Äôs bell rang. We both were already standing outside the class, we rushed to the gate. I couldn‚Äôt see my parents. Watchman uncle said that your mother left lunch. Instead of going to the class, we decided that we‚Äôll eat on the ground of our school. So, that lunch for one should only become lunch of 2 not for the whole class. Because when you take lunch to class you don‚Äôt even know when was your lunch finished if it is hot & fresh. Recess was over and so was our freedom.
<br /><br />
Period 5, my friend has changed every picture in my English textbook to either cartoons or metalhead rock band members. Art which was created by that 3 rupee ball pen cannot match the one with photoshop. The teacher saw us.
<br />
Period 6, We were standing outside the classroom playing football with the paper ball.
<br />
Period 7, played air hockey with books in the library, at least the long and broad tables of the library have one advantage. A tooth which was loose for a week finally came off, but with the help of a corner of a hardcover children rhyme book which was just a few seconds earlier, I threw it to my friend. Little blood also came.
<br />
Finally, the bell rang for our eternal freedom. I was approaching the bus. My friend shouted ‚Äú4:30‚Äù, I nodded.
<br />
<br />
Came home with a broken tooth in my shirt‚Äôs pocket. First confirmed from my mother that it will come again. For the whole day, I was feeling something is missing.
<br />
It was 4:25, in the clock. Turned to my mom, with hope in my eyes. She said with her eyes that 4:30 means 4:30. Those 5 minutes felt like an eternity. I was trying to focus on the second‚Äôs hand on the clock but then got bored in 30 seconds. Then practiced bowling without ball & batsman. First Zaheer Khan‚Äôs bowling style, then Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Ashwin, and then OG Lasith Malinga. Daydreaming about me playing in the stadium. Ended my 4 minutes imaginary practice session with a helicopter shot. It‚Äôs 4:30.
<br />
<br />
Took a walk to the ground. It was July. Everyone was doing the most enjoyable and comfortable activity of adulthood, which is taking an afternoon nap. So, there was a different kind of silence. A silence that is different from early morning silence but also different from late-night silence. This silence feels that the world is stopped. Everybody is at rest.
<br />
After somehow convincing my mother that we only play where sunlight doesn‚Äôt come and always field, bat, and bowl in the shadow of a tree. Coming to playing was also a victory in itself. Indian boys can do anything for playing cricket with friends. I repeat, anything. 
<br />

After so much laughing, shouting, cheating, losing, and winning. Sun finally went home and so did we.
