                "Cinema is not an art", my English teacher once said to me. And people still ask me why I am skeptical about the Indian education system. There is no way of understanding your reality better than art. After books, movies are the best way to learn about life without bearing the pain of it. I feel like I am on a psychedelic trip when I am experiencing a good story. I never had that experience but surely it will be very good storytelling. 
<br /><br />
Good storytelling will make you *not* question its authenticity. From love to gang rivalries, from dragons to time travel, from the 17th century to a psychedelic trip. Good storytelling can give you an experience of all of that. It is very fascinating to me that it is nothing but stories that makes identity. No wonder why people can take lives if the story they were told was a lie or questioned. At the end of the day, humans make sense of reality in stories.
<br /><br />
The true essence of filmmaking as an art has been lost in the mainstream cinema of our country. It will take years for the narration of stories to be mainstream in our country. In terms of business, this industry has been one of the most successful industries. So successful that few people who are not even in the political authority can directly influence the lives of millions.
